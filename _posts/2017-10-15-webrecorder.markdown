The web is rich in information but due to its highly dynamic nature some of this information eventually disappears (see [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)). I recently found [webrecorder.io](http://webrecorder.io), a free
service that allows you to "Create high-fidelity, interactive web archives of any web site you
browse."

The software is great, it lets you create recordings directly from their
site, or you can build and install a Chrome extension, see instructions [here](https://github.com/atomotic/webrecorder-chrome-extension).

I built one for myself, you can get it [here]({{ "/assets/webrecorder.crx" |
absolute_url }}), use at your own risk.
